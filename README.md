# Current Sectors
An upcoming R library, which: 
- empowers to drill down stock tickers from various stock exchanges across industries, sectors and regions,
- facilitates comparative analysis of shares' market performance,
- streamlines the process of sector structure analysis of stock exchanges,
- simplifies the process of stock quote data ingestion, organization and storage,
- provides useful tools all across the board of financial time series data analysts' workflows.

While there are a couple of industry and sector classifications (i.e. [GICS](https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/indexes/gics) and [ICB](https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/industry-classification-benchmark-icb)), Current Sectors relies on an internally improved and corrected version of widely adopted [Wall Street journal company classification](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/company-list/) reconstructed as **such** []. The scope of available markets narrows down the list of instruments to those available by the agency of mainstream Polish brokers regulated by [Polish Financial Supervision Authority](https://www.knf.gov.pl/).
